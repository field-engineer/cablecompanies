What are the benefits of fiber optic cabling with respect to copper cabling?

Fiber optic cables and copper cables are two options for transmitting information when configuring a network. Both are suitable for transmitting data, but fiber optic cables have several advantages over copper.

Speed
Fiber optic cables are capable of transmitting data at a faster rate than copper cables. For example, a copper cable can transmit 1,000 megabytes per second, while a fiber optic cable can transmit 10,000 megabytes per second. Fiber optic uses lights or lasers to transmit information, which allows it to have higher speeds than copper, which uses a cable to transmit data.
 Security
A copper cable can be intercepted, since transmission occurs along a cable. In fiber optic transmission is done through the use of light, so it is difficult to intercept the data. Since it is unlikely that an optical fiber cable will be intercepted, data transmission becomes much safer. Fiber optic is also resistant to electronic interference and voltage surges, while a copper cable can be affected by both factors.
Bandwidth
The bandwidth describes the amount of data that the cable is capable of transmitting. Fiber optics can typically transmit a bandwidth higher than that of copper. While a copper cable can transmit one gigabyte of data, the fiber can transmit 10 or more times that amount.
Size
Physically, a fiber optic cable is thinner and lighter than a copper cable. Since the fiber works by pulsations of light, the cable weighs less than one of copper, which is made of wire. The smaller size and weight of the fiber optic cable allow you to use it in situations where a lightweight, easy-to-install cable is required.

Advantages of fiber optic cable

Advantage

- Easy to install.
- High speed data transmission.
- Direct connection of plants to companies.
- Great bandwidth.
- The fiber optic cable, being very thin and flexible, is much lighter and occupies less space than the coaxial cable and twisted pair cable.
- Unlimited and continuous access 24 hours a day, without congestion.
- Fiber optic allows surfing the Internet, a speed of 2 million bps, available in the conventional system, in most users it connects to 28,000 or 33,600 bps.
- Video and sound in real time.
- The raw material to make it is abundant in nature.
- Compatibility with digital technology.
- Great security. The intrusion in an optical fiber is easily detectable, due to the weakening of the light energy in reception, besides it does not radiate anything, which is very interesting for applications that require a high degree of confidentiality.
- Resistance to heat, cold and corrosion.
- You can group several fiber optic cables and create a hose that carries large amounts of traffic, immune to interference.
- Insensitivity to electromagnetic interference, as occurs when a telephone cable loses part of its signal.
